=============================
gone configuration management
=============================
basic idea: 
 - rsync + shell script + git. 

 bash script with case $HOSTNAME and *) do defaults
 # apply default conf to all services
 git clone repo/conf; cd conf; ./apply
 
 ( sort of  puppet apply / slaughter applypolicy )
 " client pull + server push "
 decentralised: any node is a conf node
 server may push: set up a git pull ; ./apply cron job
 master node := temporary central git repo
 apply runs defaults + host specifics

advantages: decentralized, requires git only (no client, no server)
 # store documents in private repo
 # store code in (semipublic) repo group
 # store conf in public repo

# hook reload actions on push events with diffs!
