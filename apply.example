# Example configuration on how to apply default, host, and module specific configuration


./gone ${@:-apply defaults host/${hostname -f} modules/gonemock}

# Some other alternative approaches:
#
# Gone does not define how you structure your data, so for instance
# if you would like to group hosts by their domain name you could
# do this:
#
# ./gone ${@:-apply defaults host/$(dnsdomain)/$(hostname) modules/gonemock}
#
# The above will give allow you to have a catalog `host/` where
# applicances are named `<domain>/<host>`
#
# Adding a general 'role based' model is also straight forward,
# there are two approaches, put everything in your ./apply file
# and do a case "$host" in .....:
## case "$(hostname)" in
##   db-*)  rolE=db-server ;;
##   app-*) role=app-server ;;
## esac
#
## gone apply defaults host/$(hostname) role/$role
#
# Or you can run the default gone and recursively apply from your host
# appliance:
#
## Your host/$(hostname) applicance:
## #!/bin/sh
##
## gone apply role/my-role
#
## gone apply
